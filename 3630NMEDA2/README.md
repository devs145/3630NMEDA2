The following app helps you make a decision in terms on what to eat. The app uses device movement to determine the results.
The app gives you different results everytime there movement of 40 degrees along the z axis.
The app would give you different foods to eat such as "Italian" however it will not tell you to eat pasta this is to leave personal biases out of the app.
